NewsMonkey

An Online News App

# Project Description

NewsMonkey is a web application that provides users with the latest news from around the world. The app utilizes the NewsAPI to gather news articles from a variety of reputable sources and presents them to users in an easy-to-use interface. One of the key features of NewsMonkey is its advanced filtering options, which allow users to sort news articles by category, such as sports, entertainment, politics, and more. The app also incorporates infinite scrolling functionality, which enables users to seamlessly browse through a virtually endless stream of news articles without interruption.

<b>Objective:</b> It is to develop a web-based news aggregator that allows users to access curated news from multiple sources. Users will be able to choose news categories (e.g., sports, technology, politics) based on their interests, search for specific news items using keywords, and read brief summaries and navigate to the full articles.

<b>Scope:</b> The project involves front-end development (for user interaction), back-end development (for API integration), and the integration of a news API for fetching real-time data. The platform will be responsive, offering a seamless experience across different devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

# System Architecture

The StudyCraze ed-tech platform consists of three main components: the
front end, the back end, and the database. The platform follows a
client-server architecture, with the front end serving as the client and
the back end and database serving as the server.

### Front-end

The front end of the platform is built using ReactJS, which is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. ReactJS allows for the creation of dynamic and responsive user interfaces, which are critical for providing an engaging learning experience to the students. The front end communicates with the back end using RESTful API calls.

### Back-end

The back end of the platform is built using NodeJS and ExpressJS, which are popular frameworks for building scalable and robust server-side applications. The back end provides APIs for the front end to consume, which include functionalities such as user authentication, profile setup and password change.

### Database

The database for the platform is built using MongoDB, which is a NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable data storage solution. MongoDB allows for the storage of unstructured and semi-structured data, which is useful for storing user content such as images.
